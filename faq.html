            It is becoming clear through research that many of these conditions are caused by a combination of
            biological, psychological, and environmental factors.

          <p class="faq-answer hidden">
            Some biological factors that may be involved in the development of mental illness include: Neurochemical
            Causes: Some mental illnesses have been linked to an abnormal balance of special chemicals in the brain
            called neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters help nerve cells in the brain communicate with each other. If
            these chemicals are out of balance or are not working properly, messages may not make it through the brain
            correctly, leading to symptoms of mental illness. In addition, defects in or injury to certain areas of the
            brain have also been linked to some mental conditions. Genetics (heredity): Many mental illnesses run in
            families, suggesting that people who have a family member with a mental illness are more susceptible (have a
            greater likelihood of being affected) to developing a mental illness. Infections: Certain infections have
            been linked to brain damage and the development of mental illness or the worsening of its symptoms.
            Structural Causes: This involves possible problems in the "wiring" of different parts of the brain. This
            includes possible consequences from brain trauma.

            Certain triggering factors could be significant stressors precipitating a mental illness such as: Losses

            Most mental illnesses are caused by a combination of factors. However, some preventive measures can decrease
            the likelihood of developing mental illnesses. The concept of attributable risk has gained ground in mental
            health research and factors that are related to those can be potentially reduced to somehow prevent mental
            illnesses: prevent neglect and abuse in childhood , prevent substance abuse , prevent exposure to war ,
            increase social support , decrease burden of other health disorders , train in management of stress etc...

            If you know someone who is having symptoms of a mental disorder, do not just think that they will snap out

            While both psychiatrists and psychologists are mental health professionals, the big difference is that
            psychiatrists are medical physicians while psychologists are not. Because they are licensed physicians,
            psychiatrists can prescribe drugs. Psychologists are not allowed to do that. Psychologists on the other
            hand, use psychotherapy as a treatment method.

            It is common for people to stop taking their medication when they feel their symptoms have become
            controlled. Others may choose to stop their medication because of side effects. Another problem with
            stopping medication, especially if you stop it abruptly, is that you may develop withdrawal symptoms that
            can be very unpleasant. If you doctor feel you need to stop your medication, it is necessary to discuss it
            with your physician as he might be able to suggest another type of medication or adjust the dose of your
            medication.

            Psychotherapy in some cases can be sufficient for the treatment of certain mental conditions. However, it
            may be needed in conjunction with medication. This is why in several cases, it is not considered as a
            substitute for medication.
